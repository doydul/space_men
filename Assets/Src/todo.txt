# Planning
## Beta (one fully playable campaign)
- Misc: 3
- Workshop page: 30
- Soldier perma-death: 5
- Hiring soldiers: 5
- Items content: 
- Aliens content:
- More mission objectives: 
- Level content:

## To Do
- Replace alien sprites with new higher contrast ones
- Maybe create system for loading in different soldier sprites?

## Alpha ToDo
- Reimplement workshop page
- Add back button to selection page
- Don't show soldier icon or inv button on squad page for slots that are empty
- Meta soldier needs to somehow link to soldiers in gamestate so we know whos died
- Create a tutorial level
- Implement hiring solders from the armoury page
- Add some proper icons for post mission reward summary
- Create more levels!
- Create more aliens!
- Create more weapons! (specifically level 2 and maybe 3 weapons)

## Beta ToDo
- Ammo and reloading!
- Other misc abilities (explosive weapon fire at ground)
- Exp system!
- Unlockable soldier abilities!
- Ship teleporter! (to replace fallen soldiers mid battle)
- Special abilities for aliens!

# Refactoring
- Store ArmourStats and WeaponStats objects on soldier actor, to avoid having to fetch them all the time

# Not Urgent

- Should current mission data such as alien spawn rates be stored in scene, since there is one scene for each mission anyway?
- Implement listing of alien possible attacks
- Show the possible attack locations in presenter
- Aliens should prioritise moving to squares where they can attack multiple soldiers at once
- Large aliens' sprites should appear over the top of smaller aliens, and they should be able to displace smaller aliens in order to get to soldiers (so player can't use smaller, less damaging aliens as shield against larger more damaging ones)

# Random Ideas

- Persistent flames from flame weapons
- Show damage chance above aliens heads?

# Principles

- Clarity: How easy it is to see/find all the consequences of a given action
- Flexibility: How easy is it to add new functionality without altering existing classes
- Dependence: How difficult is it to change without breaking other parts of the application or preventing compilation
- Complexity: Does the benefit outweight the complexity that it introduces
- Tell Don't Ask
- Seperate Logic and Data
