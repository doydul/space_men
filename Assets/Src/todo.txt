# Item construction / research screen

- Allows constructing weapons and armour based on blueprints that have been aquired by dismantling existing items

- Also allows 'scrapping' items to return resources

- Allow recruiting of new soldiers

# Implement armour specific abilities

- Scout gets additional movement (maybe two extra squares for running and 4 extra for sprinting?)

- Mid level armour can use heavy weapons

- Dreadnaught armour cannot sprint (but is super beefy)

# Persistent flames from flame weapons

- Should last 1 or 2 turns and set fire to anything that passes through them

- Flames do 1 tick of damage at the moment when the target is set on fire and then 1 tick at the end of each turn thereafter

# Exp and skills system

- Might have to put a pin in this one, but a basic system of earning exp and levelling up would be nice



# Friendly fire damage from blast weapons
