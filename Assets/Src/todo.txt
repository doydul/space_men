# Refactoring alien spawner

## Bugs
- Aliens jump around a bit weirdly if they are already next to a soldier at the start of their movement (need a way of making their behaviour more predictable and less weird)
- Progress turn button can be pressed while animations are still running

- Inspect selected item interactor should be removed: all soldier and alien state should already be known by the UI, ready to be displayed when something is selected
- Possible soldier moves interactor should also be removed

- Remove references to Storage class in interactor and in GamePhase

## Do animations
- Zoom camera on aliens as they move, like it did before
- Add delay between moving aliens, to make it more dramatic
- Add alien attack icon 
- Animate soldier shooting too i guess

# Not Urgent

- Trigger walk on tile events in MoveSoldierPresenter


# Random Ideas

- Re-add templar and alien health bars (show temporarily after something gets hurt)
- Allow player to select aliens as well as soldiers, and show how far they can move/attack (also show stats like health, armour, damage)
- Friendly fire damage from blast weapons
- Persistent flames from flame weapons
- Show damage chance above aliens heads?

## UI for inspecting templars and aliens

### Movement Phase

- Click on soldier, select soldier
- Click on alien, select alien

### Shooting Phase

- Click soldier, select soldier,
- Click alien who is _not_ currently a valid shooting target, select alien

### General

- Needs to be a button somewhere to toggle info view (current keyboard shortcut is no good)
- When soldier is selected, shows valid moves / shoot targets
- When alien is selected, shows how far the alien can move, with different colours denoting the number of move iterations
- When anything is selected, should activate it's healthbar

# Art

- 3 portraits; one for each armour type. 4 Colour scheme variations each?

- 1 icon version for each armour, showing just the head (4 colours schemes each)

- 1 top down version of each armour for in game, with 4 colour schemes each

- A whole bunch of aliens

- Guns, lots of guns; 4 types (conventional, assault, heavy, flamer) with 4 adjectives (short, explosive, multiple barrels, energy), making 16 potential permutations. These will be displayed in the shop/inventory screen

- In game these will be represented by 3 models, a regular sized gun, a fatter more beefy gun, and a shoulder mounted (heavy) gun. The only necessary adjective is energy, which will be represented by a sort of glow, which can be tuned depending on the intensity of energy-ness that the gun has.

- Map tiles; 1 outer corner tile, 3 wall tiles, 1 inner corner tile, 3 floor tiles, 1 roof tile

- UI; arrow


# Next Milestone

- Reimplement alien movement and attack animations

- Reimplement alien radar blips

- Refactor remaining in game actions: ✓✓
  - Soldier turning ✓
  - Soldier shooting ✓

- Improve UI to acceptable levels:
  - Button for inspecting soldier stats
  - Health bars on Map
  - Ability to inspect alien stats and show possible alien moves on Map
  - Combat indicators to show combat results like 'missed', 'deflected' (damage dealth will be indicated by health bar)

- Implement secondary objectives to give weapon rewards

- Content:
  - A basic set of weapons, up to level 2 (10 per level, so 20 in total)
  - Basic set of armour (1 per type per level, makes 6)
  - Some level 1 and level 2 aliens (4 level 1, 3 level 2, 7 total)
  - One campaign, over 5 levels with a different type of objective for each one (might be too ambitious!)

# Principles

- Clarity: How easy it is to see/find all the consequences of a given action
- Flexibility: How easy is it to add new functionality without altering existing classes
- Dependence: How difficult is it to change without breaking other parts of the application or preventing compilation
- Complexity: Does the benefit outweight the complexity that it introduces
