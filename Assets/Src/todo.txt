# Refactoring alien spawner

## Bugs
- Progress turn button can be pressed while animations are still running (because input is only disabled in soldier shoot presenter, not in game phase presenter)
- Soldiers can't shoot past other soldiers
- Soldier ammo indicators dont update
- Soldier movement indicators dont update

- Hookup mission complete scene so that it shows the rewards that have been won (held in mission complete initializer)


- Implement metagamestate
  - Add method for loading metagame state from Persistent storage somehow
  - Meta soldier needs to somehow link to soldiers in gamestate so we know whos died

# Not Urgent

- Should current mission data such as alien spawn rates be stored in scene, since there is one scene for each mission anyway?
- Implement listing of alien possible attacks
- Show the possible attack locations in presenter
- Aliens jump around a bit weirdly if they are already next to a soldier at the start of their movement (need a way of making their behaviour more predictable and less weird)


# Random Ideas

- Persistent flames from flame weapons
- Show damage chance above aliens heads?

## UI for inspecting templars and aliens

- When anything is selected, should activate it's healthbar

# Art

- 3 portraits; one for each armour type. 4 Colour scheme variations each?

- 1 icon version for each armour, showing just the head (4 colours schemes each)

- 1 top down version of each armour for in game, with 4 colour schemes each

- A whole bunch of aliens

- Guns, lots of guns; 4 types (conventional, assault, heavy, flamer) with 4 adjectives (short, explosive, multiple barrels, energy), making 16 potential permutations. These will be displayed in the shop/inventory screen

- In game these will be represented by 3 models, a regular sized gun, a fatter more beefy gun, and a shoulder mounted (heavy) gun. The only necessary adjective is energy, which will be represented by a sort of glow, which can be tuned depending on the intensity of energy-ness that the gun has.

- Map tiles; 1 outer corner tile, 3 wall tiles, 1 inner corner tile, 3 floor tiles, 1 roof tile

- UI; arrow

# Principles

- Clarity: How easy it is to see/find all the consequences of a given action
- Flexibility: How easy is it to add new functionality without altering existing classes
- Dependence: How difficult is it to change without breaking other parts of the application or preventing compilation
- Complexity: Does the benefit outweight the complexity that it introduces
- Tell Don't Ask
- Seperate Logic and Data
