# Polish

- Re-add templar and alien health bars

# Code

- Allow player to select aliens as well as soldiers, and show how far they can move/attack (also show stats like health, armour, damage)

## Skills system

- Might have to put a pin in this one, but a basic system of earning exp and levelling up would be nice

## UI for inspecting templars and aliens

## Friendly fire damage from blast weapons

## Persistent flames from flame weapons

- Should last 1 or 2 turns and set fire to anything that passes through them

- Flames do 1 tick of damage at the moment when the target is set on fire and then 1 tick at the end of each turn thereafter


# Art

- 3 portraits; one for each armour type. 4 Colour scheme variations each?

- 1 icon version for each armour, showing just the head (4 colours schemes each)

- 1 top down version of each armour for in game, with 4 colour schemes each

- A whole bunch of aliens

- Guns, lots of guns; 4 types (conventional, assault, heavy, flamer) with 4 adjectives (short, explosive, multiple barrels, energy), making 16 potential permutations. These will be displayed in the shop/inventory screen

- In game these will be represented by 3 models, a regular sized gun, a fatter more beefy gun, and a shoulder mounted (heavy) gun. The only necessary adjective is energy, which will be represented by a sort of glow, which can be tuned depending on the intensity of energy-ness that the gun has.

- Map tiles; 1 outer corner tile, 3 wall tiles, 1 inner corner tile, 3 floor tiles, 1 roof tile

- UI; arrow
