# Refactoring alien spawner

## Implement class that will find the spawn locations of aliens given the spawn point location (and add to ProgressGamePhaseInteractor)

##

- Implement ProgressGamePhasePresenter (update current phase text, change soldier icons if phase has changed, create new aliens, move aliens, and show attack animations for aliens)

- Implement alien movement as part of ProgressGamePhaseInteractor

- Implement soldier turning as an interactor (important for shooting!)

- Implement Shooting as interactor


# Not Urgent

- Trigger walk on tile events in MoveSoldierPresenter


# Random Ideas

- Re-add templar and alien health bars (show temporarily after something gets hurt)
- Allow player to select aliens as well as soldiers, and show how far they can move/attack (also show stats like health, armour, damage)
- Friendly fire damage from blast weapons
- Persistent flames from flame weapons
- Show damage chance above aliens heads?

## UI for inspecting templars and aliens

### Movement Phase

- Click on soldier, select soldier
- Click on alien, select alien

### Shooting Phase

- Click soldier, select soldier,
- Click alien who is _not_ currently a valid shooting target, select alien

### General

- Needs to be a button somewhere to toggle info view (current keyboard shortcut is no good)
- When soldier is selected, shows valid moves / shoot targets
- When alien is selected, shows how far the alien can move, with different colours denoting the number of move iterations
- When anything is selected, should activate it's healthbar

# Art

- 3 portraits; one for each armour type. 4 Colour scheme variations each?

- 1 icon version for each armour, showing just the head (4 colours schemes each)

- 1 top down version of each armour for in game, with 4 colour schemes each

- A whole bunch of aliens

- Guns, lots of guns; 4 types (conventional, assault, heavy, flamer) with 4 adjectives (short, explosive, multiple barrels, energy), making 16 potential permutations. These will be displayed in the shop/inventory screen

- In game these will be represented by 3 models, a regular sized gun, a fatter more beefy gun, and a shoulder mounted (heavy) gun. The only necessary adjective is energy, which will be represented by a sort of glow, which can be tuned depending on the intensity of energy-ness that the gun has.

- Map tiles; 1 outer corner tile, 3 wall tiles, 1 inner corner tile, 3 floor tiles, 1 roof tile

- UI; arrow
