# Planning
## Beta (one fully playable campaign)
- Misc: 3
- Items content: 
- Aliens content:
- More mission objectives: 
- Level content:

## Next
- create worker for inflicting damage, removing the actor from the game state and then returning a damage instance

- make sure critical hit marker shows even when attack is fatal
- create a new medium enemy which moves 2 squares but does high damage and high armour pen
- create a new fast enemy which does high damage but does no armour pen
- improve ui 
  - make shooting phase progress automatically to movement if there are no actions to take
  - add warning ui for when a soldier is low on health or ammo

- create basic screen which can display unlockables (ON HOLD)
  - create unlockable item script/prefab
    - has a list of inspector variables, one for each unlockable type, that stores a sprite
    - has init method that takes unlockable type and displays the correct sprite with reflection
  - create hella sweet script that can layout the unlockables in a tree configuration
  - create UnlockablesInitializer
  - create OpenUnlockablesScreen interactor
    - should return list of unlockables and unspent ability point count
  - create UnlockAbilityInteractor
  - create back button

## Bugs
- sometimes aliens don't pile in properly 
  - on second mission, if soldiers are left still aliens won't go round the sides of them
- actor actions don't get cleared when a ship ability is selected
- if you go into weapon/armour/soldier select and press select before selecting anything, causes backtrace and you have to go back
- if soldier kills himself, he cannot be replaced with teleport?

## Alpha ToDo
- Exp system! 4
  - meta soldier must be able to store record of which abilities have been picked
  - need interactor for returning all abilities
    - should show which ones have already been unlocked for the given soldier, and how many unspent ability points
  - need interactor for unlocking an ability
- ability unlock screen 3
  - whole new screen!
  - shows (scrollable?) map of all possible abilities
- barracks screen 4
  - whole new screen!
  - shows all soldiers, including those in squad
  - has buttons that either take you to the soldiers inventory or just take you straight to weapon and armour select
- create mechanism for saving game state
  - add method to MetaGameState called CreateSave or something
  - pass that to IMetaGameStateStore
- don't remove metasoldiers when they die, just mark them dead instead 2
  - dead soldiers can still be part of the squad, they will have skull and crossbones over their face in armoury
  - do not spawn dead soldiers in mission, or allow them to be added to the squad

## Beta ToDo
- Create more levels!
- Create more aliens!
- Create more weapons! (specifically level 2 and maybe 3 weapons)
- Special abilities for aliens!

# Not Urgent

- Should current mission data such as alien spawn rates be stored in scene, since there is one scene for each mission anyway?
- Implement listing of alien possible attacks
- Show the possible attack locations in presenter
- Aliens should prioritise moving to squares where they can attack multiple soldiers at once
- Large aliens' sprites should appear over the top of smaller aliens, and they should be able to displace smaller aliens in order to get to soldiers (so player can't use smaller, less damaging aliens as shield against larger more damaging ones)

# Random Ideas

- Persistent flames from flame weapons
- Show damage chance above aliens heads?

# New Interactor Checklist
- add line from interactor into initializer
- add new property on controller to store the interactor
- add presenter script to scene
- *do implementation*
- create method in controller that calls interactor
- add any required inspector variables to presenter and controller

# Principles

- Clarity: How easy it is to see/find all the consequences of a given action
- Flexibility: How easy is it to add new functionality without altering existing classes
- Dependence: How difficult is it to change without breaking other parts of the application or preventing compilation
- Complexity: Does the benefit outweight the complexity that it introduces
- Tell Don't Ask
- Seperate Logic and Data


# First prompt
*Movement Phase*
The highlighted squares show where your soldier can move. Green squares show the area in which your soldier can move whilst still being able to shoot in the shooting phase. The arrows at each side of the screen allow you to manually set the soldiers orientation. The soldiers facing cannot be changed during the shooting phase, so choose wisely.

# Second prompt
When you're done moving, press the Continue button to advance to the shooting phase. 

# Third prompt
*Shooting Phase*
The shooting phase is when you can shoot, but it's also when the aliens will make their moves. Each alien will move 3 times, and before/after each move you will get a chance to shoot them if any of your soldiers are able to. If none of your soldiers can shoot, either because they've run out of shots or because they're facing the wrong way, then the aliens will move automatically. Otherwise, they will move when you press the Continue button.

Each soldier's available shots are displayed above their head. Clicking on a soldier will highlight their available targets in red. Then, click on a highlighted enemy to shoot.
