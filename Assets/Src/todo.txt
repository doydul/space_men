## Bugs

## Gameplay
- Implement threat timer
  - Each mission needs threat timer number (to denote turns before threat increases)
  - Each mission needs an array of threat increase objects to indicate the extra spawners that will exist when threat increases
  - Fire scripting events when threat increases?
  - Add UI to show threat level, and number of turns until threat increases
- Implement a secondary objective using the scripting system (with some UI to confirm that the objective has been completed)

## Features
- Stop mission start interactor from spawning soldiers who aren't in the current squad
- Reimplement workshop page
- Add back button to selection page
- Meta soldier needs to somehow link to soldiers in gamestate so we know whos died
- Implement hiring solders from the armoury page

# Refactoring
- Store ArmourStats and WeaponStats objects on soldier actor, to avoid having to fetch them all the time

# Not Urgent

- Should current mission data such as alien spawn rates be stored in scene, since there is one scene for each mission anyway?
- Implement listing of alien possible attacks
- Show the possible attack locations in presenter
- Aliens jump around a bit weirdly if they are already next to a soldier at the start of their movement (need a way of making their behaviour more predictable and less weird)


# Random Ideas

- Persistent flames from flame weapons
- Show damage chance above aliens heads?

## UI for inspecting templars and aliens

- When anything is selected, should activate it's healthbar

# Principles

- Clarity: How easy it is to see/find all the consequences of a given action
- Flexibility: How easy is it to add new functionality without altering existing classes
- Dependence: How difficult is it to change without breaking other parts of the application or preventing compilation
- Complexity: Does the benefit outweight the complexity that it introduces
- Tell Don't Ask
- Seperate Logic and Data
