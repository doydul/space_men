# Squad Screen

- Accessed from the mission briefing screen, at least for now

- 6 boxes (already have)

- Underneath each box is a button marked 'inv' which takes the user to the inventory page for that soldier

- If the portrait for a soldier is pressed, the user is instead taken to the character select screen, where they can choose to replace that soldier in the squad roster

- when selecting items, also shows the items that are currently equipped by soldiers who are not in the roster. Such items will automatically be traded between soldiers if selected
