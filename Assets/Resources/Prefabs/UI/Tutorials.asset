  tutorials:
  - key: intro
    value: welcome to the battle map commander. tap one of your soldiers to start
      issuing them orders
  - key: select_soldier
    value: the green highlights show tiles your soldier can move to. tap a tile to
      make your soldier move there
  - key: first_encounter
    value: this is an alien! aliens will be alerted if you move too close or if they
      encounter gunfire. click on them to see more information
  - key: alien_info
    value: this panel shows key statistics about the alien. the map tiles highlighted
      in red show where the alien can move/attack on it's next turn
  - key: armoured_enemy
    value: aliens with armour take half damage from any attack whose damage value
      is less than or equal to the armour value. they're vulnerable to energy weapons
      or weapons with high damage values
  - key: basic_attack
    value: this alien is highlighted because the selected soldier can attack it.
      tapping it will initiate a basic attack
  - key: doors
    value: this is a door. doors block movement and line of sight for humans and
      aliens. if one of your units is adjacent to a door, it can be opened as a free
      action by tapping on it. but beware, once a door has been opened it can't be
      closed again
  - key: movement
    value: the number of tiles a soldier can move in a turn is determined by the
      armour it has equipped. its movement can be extended by using the sprint ability,
      but this uses an action (each soldier gets one action per turn)
  - key: abilities
    value: these are your soldier's abilities, tap them to see what they do. some
      abilities, like sprint, are available to all soldiers, while others are dependant
      on the armour and weapon that the soldier has equipped
  - key: crates
    value: every mission will contain crates like this one. they can contain credits,
      weapons and armour. picking up a crate is a free action for any soldier standing
      adjacent
